# Linkedin + Descope Next.js Sample App

This app showcases the power of using Descope to manage your provider tokens. :zap:

## Getting Started ðŸš€

Follow these steps to clone the repository and start using the app.

### Prerequisites

- An account on [Descope](https://descope.com/).
- A [LinkedIn Developer Application](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps).

### LinkedIn Provider Application Setup

You will have to connect your own LinkedIn Provider Application in Descope to manage Provider tokens. 

- First, if you do not already have one, create a LinkedIn Provider Application [here](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps).
- Under the Products tab on your LinkedIn Provider Application, request access to "Share on LinkedIn" and "Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect".
- Connect the application to Descope, by choosing Linkedin under the [Authentication Methods page](https://app.descope.com/settings/authentication/social) in the Descope Console. Choose "use my own account" and enter the Client ID and Client Secret found in the Auth tab on your Linkedin Provider Application. Under `scopes` add "w_member_social", and under `Advanced Settings` enable "Manage tokens from provider."
